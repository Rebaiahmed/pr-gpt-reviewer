## Why?

Save reviewer time. On each pull request, this bot fetches the diff, asks OpenAI for a concise summary + actionable feedback, and posts (or returns) the results.

---

## How it works

1. **Trigger**: A PR is opened/synchronized.
2. **Fetch diff**: The bot calls the GitHub API for the PR `.diff`.
3. **Review**: The diff is sent to OpenAI with a structured prompt.
4. **Output**: Summary + suggestions are posted as a PR comment (CI) or returned from the API (local).
